# Dear Reader

If you are seeing this repository, it means that you have probably already contacted me, 
or you might be considering doing so.

The repository includes code showcases from ongoing and some legacy projects.

In addition to my examples, I want to share the vision of the development process. It's brief.

## Know your Programmer

These examples have been written in various programming languages, at different times. 
Nonetheless, the responsibility for the results is equal.

- Write orthogonal code (fewer dependencies are better).
- Adhere to the `ETC (Easier To Change)` value.
- Use comments to explain `why` and not `what`.
- Avoid `global` data.
- Follow the `DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)` principle.
- Always design with contracts (`less is more`).
- `Think` about your work.

## Why do I highlight these points?

I do not pursue perfection at all costs. 
When `good-enough` software is best, one can cultivate the discipline to 
produce software that meets this standard.

My objective: consistently striving for adequacy. 
Adequacy for users, for future maintainers, and for my own peace of mind.

## Examples

I've included only code snippets or brief examples to mitigate the risk of breaching non-disclosure agreements. 
Function names, variables, and even comments are changed to avoid any coincidence with the live code.

All examples shown are just for understanding.

### What you can find in `examples` folder

#### golang

- `pool` implementation based on channels with possibility to set pool capacity.
- `card` implementation of core functionality for credit card validation and classification.

#### python

- `middleware` playing a proxy role between frontend and backend service.
- `imap` wrapper. IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol. It is an application layer protocol used to receive the emails from the mail server.

#### typescript

Code snippets demonstrates some components, routes and socket implementation.
